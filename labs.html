            <p>ALL Lab submissions must include:</p>
            
            <ol>
               <li>LINK</li>

               <li>VALIDATION - 1 WORD DOCUMENT - NOT ZIPPED</li>
               
               <li>ZIPPED FOLDER</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
               Lab solution files will auto release after the lab due date has passed.  
               The solutions files can be found in the same module as the lab.  It is 
               your responsibility to check your code against the solution and correct 
               your mistakes before moving on the the next lab.  Labs build on each other, 
               so if you do not fix mistakes from a previous lab, it will carry over to 
               your new lab and you will loose points again.
            </p>

            <p>
               Due:  All labs are due by Sunday at 11:59pm of the module that they are in. 
               Labs submitted late or labs which do not include a link to your lab, 
               zipped file with all lab files, and word document with screenshots 
               showing validation will not receive credit.
            </p>
