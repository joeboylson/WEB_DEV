                        </dt>
                        <dd>Intended for beginners and anyone wishing a grounded foundation in the practice of yoga, this 60
                              minute class of poses and slow movement focuses on asana (proper alignment and posture), pranayama

                  <h2> Relax Anytime with Savasana </h2>

                  <p> Prepare yourself for savasana. Lie down on your yoga mat with your arms at your side with palms up. Close
                        your eyes and breathe slowly but deeply. Sink into the mat and let your worries slip away. When you
                        are ready, roll on your side and use your arms to push yourself to a sitting position with crossed
                        legs. Place your hands in a prayer position. Be grateful for all that you have in life. Namaste.
                        </p>
